### Game Concept:
The concept of the extra credit game I created “Super Man and the Jaws of Death” is a Flappy Bird-like style game. In the game you are a blue ball that can jump in the air. Your purpose is to jump though gaps in oncoming green pipes without hitting the pipes. The gaps happen at random heights on the pipe. 

### How to play: 
To play the game you TAP the spacebar on your keyboard to jump through the air. You are only moving forward so all you must do is not hit the green pipes. If you do hit the green pipes, just press “R” to restart and play as many times again as you want. Every time you jump though a gap without hitting the pipe you earn a point. See how many points you can get! Have fun!
