## Game Overview:
### Game Title: 
Superman and the Jaws of Death
### Game Summary:
  Superman and the Jaws of Death is a Flappy Bird-like style game. In the game you play as superman flying through a giant intergalatic monsters mouth and throat. You have to avoid its teeth. Your purpose is to jump through the gaps until you reach each checkpoint. If you get far enough you can fly into the heart, kill the monster, and save the universe. 
  To play the game you TAP the spacebar on your keyboard to jump through the air. You are only moving forward so all you must do is not hit the white teeth. If you do hit the teeth, just quit, go back to the main menu, and restart the game. Every time you fly through a gap without hitting something you earn a point. See if you can earn 30 points and get to the heart. Have fun!

## Story and Narrative:
The Universe is threatened by an intergalatic monster called "Death". He devours planets and is coming straight for Earth. The humans call upon Superman to save them. This is no easy task for Superman however. He is stuck in a block of ice and he must go straight into the belly of the beast and fly through the heart to kill it. Watch out though! There are rows and rows of teeth waiting for whatever the monster devours. Good Luck Superman! The weight of the universe hangs in the balance. If you do not find a way, no one will.
